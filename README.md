## Concept

> With the advent of the pandemic, organizations and institutions across the globe were forced to quickly shift to remote work/learning and this lead to the meteoric rise in the usage of platforms like  Zoom,  Google  Meet,  Microsoft  Teams  etc.   
> Incorporation of such platforms into the daily workflows have proven to be monotonous and its impact on oneâ€™s mental and physical wellbeing have been a matter of concern.
> The proposed solution implements a close to life environment that reflects the typical day to day activities of offline offices, classrooms etc. 
> * Users can create 2D avatars with which they can walk around a virtual office/classroom and interact with each other and the environment as opposed to being just a tile in a video call like in the existing systems.
> * Users can communicate with each other via Proximity based RTC.
> * We go one step beyond existing systems by providing tools/aids that helps boost user productivity, such as Post it notes, Whiteboards, Timers, Fatigue detection and more.
