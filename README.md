    With the advent of the pandemic, organizations and institutions across the globe were forced to quickly shift to remote work/learning and this lead to the meteoric rise in the usage of platforms like  Zoom,  Google  Meet,  Microsoft  Teams  etc.   Over  time  people  from  different  walks  of  life incorporated these platforms into their daily workflow to only realize that the continuous usage of these platforms had become monotonous and had taken a toll on one's mental well being as such  platforms  provided  a  mere  source  of  communication  without  factoring  in  the  underlying characteristics  of  a  typical  human  conversation.  

    Hence,  the  need  of  the  hour  is  to  develop  a platform that provides the technical functionality of the above mentioned platforms along with certain features that brings in a sense of connection amongst individuals.

We attempt to implements a close to life environment that reflects the typical day to day activities of offline offices, classrooms etc. Users can create 2D avatars with which they can walk around a virtual office/classroom and interact with each other and the environment. 
Each room in the office is a virtual voice channel that cannot be listened to by people outside of the room. Meeting rooms can be locked to allow for privacy by higher ranking employees, and create a real office space experience. Each user can have their own office space that they can decorate and customise.
