```
We attempt to implements a close to life environment that reflects the typical day to day activities of offline offices, classrooms etc. Users can create 2D avatars with which they can walk around a virtual office/classroom and interact with each other and the environment. 
Each room in the office is a virtual voice channel that cannot be listened to by people outside of the room. Meeting rooms can be locked to allow for privacy by higher ranking employees, and create a real office space experience. Each user can have their own office space that they can decorate and customise.
